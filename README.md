I implemented haar cascade algorithms. All of these algorithms are directly or 
indirectly related to computer vision and neural networks and are efficiently implemented in our 
project. The project will mark the Attendance of specified individuals based on their face 
recognition. The features of facial expressions are detected and trained, and this will be used to 
detect them and to mark their Attendance in excel sheets.
